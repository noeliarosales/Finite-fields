## Project Description

In this project, I implemented the basic operations of **finite fields** and **rings** using **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

The project covers the following algebraic structures:

- The finite field: `Fp`, where \( p \) is prime
- The polynomial ring: `Fp[x]`
- The extension field `Fq`, defined as the quotient `Fp[x] / <g(x)>`, where `g(x)` is an irreducible polynomial over `Fp`
- The polynomial ring: `Fq[x]`
The goal of the project is to provide a clear and modular implementation of these algebraic structures.
