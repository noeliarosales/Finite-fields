## Project Description

In this project, I implemented the basic operations of **finite fields** and **rings** using **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

Let \( p \) be a prime number. The project covers the following algebraic structures:

- Finite fields: `Fp`, where \( p \) is prime
- Polynomial rings: `Fp[x]`
- Finite field extensions: `Fq`, defined as  
  \[
  F_q = F_p[x] / \langle g(x) \rangle
  \]
  where \( g(x) \) is an irreducible polynomial over \( F_p \)
- Polynomial rings over finite fields: `Fq[x]`
The goal of the project is to provide a clear and modular implementation of these algebraic structures.
